# DiscordVouchLogger
Logs Discord Messages from a channel onto a website.

Discord bot needs permissions to read channels & messages. You give the bot the channel ID you want it to watch. The bot will save all the messages (including the name & time-stamp).
The bot uses MongoDB to store messages.
ServerJS pushes everything onto index.html, where you can edit the website to your desires.

Will include how to set everything up later.
